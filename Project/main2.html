<a id="intro"></a><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
	
<p>My name is El Shaddai Mhango. I am twenty-five years old. I was born and raised in Malawi, Africa. I am currently studying computer science at KVCC. I began my music career when I was nine years old, possibly because my parents had a variety of music instruments in the house that allowed me to play with music instruments as toys as a child. As I grew older I developed the desire and interest to learn how to play them. My Mother and my siblings are musicians too and that has ushered me to learn and expand my understanding of music.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here is a list of instruments I play</strong></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Keyboard</li>
  <li>Drums</li>
  <li>Bass</li>
  <li>Rhythm Guitar</li>
  <li>Recorder</li>
  <li>and other percussions</li>
</ul>
<p>
I began with learning drums, then piano, and then bass, before deciding to major in piano. My first major musical achievement was performing in Mozambique when I was only twelve years old, which sparked my interest in music and motivated me to practice more. When I was eighteen, I flew to South Africa to play at various events, where I stayed for over four years. </p>

	<a id="compete"></a><h3>THE MUSIC COMPETITION</h3>
	
<p>Last year January the 1st there was held a Northern region music <a href="https://www.facebook.com/100043130257464/posts/pfbid02mcAouBGtdkiqan2Eac3pz54KFGjWq7eFdsrYJnLTd4uUwFtHTwETNuFuiSbXMV6Gl/?app=fbl"> <em>competition</em> </a> for artistes and music bands in the northern region of Malawi. I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izWJS1bJVAs">played</a> piano for two of the artistes who were competing for the position. It was a rough and tough competition such that none of the artistes I was playing piano for won the prize. Initially the competition was for the actual artistes, however, the competition organizers announced at the start of the event that sub-categories would compete at the end of the main show to crown individuals as the best stage performer, guitarist, pianists, vocalist, and so on. The sudden announcement of the news made everything more exciting and challenging. I was ready to contest, but I was also so tensed because this meeting gathered many musicians, even some of great renown across the region which is as big as one third of the country.</p>
<p>
It was time to perform and even more intensifying, I was randomly chosen to be the first performer. I gave it all I had and played the piano and truly I could feel the potential of emerging the winner but of course that was just the emotion every other competitor probably felt. Off the stage, most of my friends who believed in me assured me that I would be crowned, judging from what they heard me play. They said “We don't expect anyone else to play any better,” which gave me so much hope, anticipation, and affirmation. My friends were right! At the end of the day I was crowned the best pianist in the northern region. We celebrated it and it was such a triumphant entry into the new year of 2023.</p>

This moment greatly transformed my life, my awareness, and my esteem, and marked a symbol of success and progress in my music career. Since music is an endless journey, I know the win is just the beginning.
